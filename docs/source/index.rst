Welcome to KDL's documentation!
===============================

K Descriptor Language (KDL) serves as a domain specific language for authoring 
and manipulating KNIME workflows.  The KDL Compiler (kdlc) accepts knwf archives, 
which withhold exported KNIME workflows and outputs equivalent KDL documents.  
Similarly, kdlc accepts KDL documents and outputs knwf archives.
